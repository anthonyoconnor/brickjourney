# Welcome to Brick Journey

Brick Journey documents my family's journey of exploring the world of LEGO bricks. We love playing with and building LEGO. Recently I have started taking pictures of LEGO minfigures. Head to the <a href="../photos">photo gallery</a> to see the pictures. 

We will also be making stop motion LEGO brickfilms which can be seen on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaMQNU0Oxfehas7zLRYMYMA" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>. Please check it out. After each video I do a review to see what we can learn to make our next video even better. See the reviews in the <a href="../videos">video section</a>.

If you have any questions send me an email to anthonyoconnor@gmail.com.
