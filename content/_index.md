# Welcome to Brick Journey

Brick Journey documents my family's journey of exploring the world of LEGO bricks. We love playing with and building LEGO. 

We make stop motion LEGO brickfilms which can be seen on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaMQNU0Oxfehas7zLRYMYMA" target="_blank">youtube channel</a>. Please check it out. After making each video I like to do a review of it to see what I can learn to make the next video even better. See the reviews in the <a href="../videos">video section</a>.

Jack is 6 and likes to make Brickfilms too. All his films are included in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-K7hksXg5gJZsMZgCshpYUW2NlUrcOCd" target="_blank">this playlist</a>.

I also take pictures of LEGO minfigures. Head to the <a href="../photos">photo gallery</a> to see the pictures.

If you have any questions send me an email to anthonyoconnor@gmail.com.
