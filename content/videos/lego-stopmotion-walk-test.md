This was the first proper walk cycle test video. I watched some videos that teach walk cycles and tried it with a minifig.

This was the first time using the [Stop Motion Studio](https://www.cateater.com/ "cateater - Stop Motion Studio") app on iPhone. This app allows you to add titles, sounds and transition. Overall the app seems pretty good and easy to use.

I still didn't have proper lighting so there is some flickering.

Details:

* Shot with [Stop Motion Studio](https://www.cateater.com/ "cateater - Stop Motion Studio") 
* iPhone camera
* 108 Frames
* 12 fps

Things to improve on:

* The Lighting wasn't great and flickered a bit
* There was a little camera movement between some frames
* The walk could be smoother
