I was away from home for a few days and grabbed two minifigs before leaving. I tried experimenting with moving minifigs on a surface other than a baseplate. This video was shot in a kitchen and surprisingly the lighting turned out ok. It's just a short fun video.

It's a lot harder to move minifigs on a random surfact since there are no studs to stick them to. I used white sticky tack on the minifigs feet in some scenes to stabilize them. You can see it in some shots since I didn't bother removing it while processing the images.



Details:

* Shot with Stop Motion Studio
* iPhone camera
* 156 Frames
* 12 fps

Things to improve on:

* Take extra effort to remove stick tack from the pictures if it is visible
* Extra frames were needed when pulling the figure out of the ground to give a better animation
