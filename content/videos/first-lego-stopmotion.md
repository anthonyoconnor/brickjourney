This was my first attempt at LEGO stop motion. This was a pretty bare bones attempt. I just grabbed a LEGO minifig and baseplate and started taking pictures. Initally I was just going to try a walk cycle but it eventually turned into the minifig taking his helmet off. I didn't pay any attention to the lighting, just using the normal lights in the room. I also didn't secure the baseplate.

The resolution is only 240p. I don't remember how I actually converted the images to a video but whatever I used obviously wasn't a good option. At the time I was trying to find a free program to use on the PC so tried a few but none were great.

Things to improve on:

* Secure baseplate to avoid it moving between shots
* Pay attention to white balance to ensure colours look correct. 
* Use a proper HD resolution
* Use sound
