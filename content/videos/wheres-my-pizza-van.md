I tried to make a different type of stop motion video: a build stop motion video. This was an experiment since I had no idea what kind of frame rate would be needed. I just took a photo after placing every piece so there was some playing around with the framerate afterwards to see what worked. This means that some of the video is too fast and others too slow.

I had a better light setup for this but I bumped off the lights and moved them slightly a few times during the filming which lead to some flickering during playback.

I had some issues with the focus changing in Stop Motion Studio. Since the build was taking a photo after every piece I started rushing through it. Some of the frames are out of focus and I didn't notice until putting the final video together.

Details:

* Shot with Stop Motion Studio
* 259 Frames
* 9 fps

Things to improve on:

* The rotating of the chassis was too fast so it was hard to see what was happening
* The pizza guy getting in the van at the end needed more pictures/frames
* There was some changes to the lighting during filming from bumping off the lights so different parts of the video had slightly different lighting and flickering
* The tripod shifted a few times so there is some movement of the frame
* Some frames out of focus, check the focus during the process rather than assuming it is correct
* Take more time during the build process rather than rushing it
